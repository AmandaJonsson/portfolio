        <div class="desc" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                This bachelor thesis project was carried out in collaboration with Museum 2020, which is a project initiated 
                in 2016 at the Institution of Applied IT in Gothenburg, Sweden. Museum 2020 focuses on the digitising of 
                society and their implications for public institutions, for example museums. Their purpose is to explore
                how public institutions can continue to be knowledge nodes in a time when media and society are becoming 
                more and more digitised.<br><br>

                We designed and developed an native iOS application for Universeum. The development of the application was made in 
                two design iterations. We gathered requirements, did prototypes, performed test sessions and evaluated.
                The images below is our final prototype and the design of the final application looked almost exactly like this.
