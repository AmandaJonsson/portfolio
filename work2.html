			Grab(it)y, an interactive and explorative game where the players experience the gravitational force at Mars. 
			The project was developed in collaboration with the Chalmers University of Technology and Universeum and 
			exhibited on the 25th and 26th of October 2019 at Universeum, Gothenburg, Sweden. The theme of the project 
			was ‘showing the invisible’ and the target group were kids between the ages of 12-16. 
			
			<!--The installation consists of a trampoline (3 meters diameter), a Kinect camera and a wall to project the game on. The experience starts 
			before the user enters the trampoline. There are two big posters on either side of the trampoline, so it will 
			be seen independent of what direction the user comes from. The posters act as an eye-catcher with a descriptive 
			title of what to expect of the installation. The entrance to the trampoline acts as a portal to Mars, to evoke 
			the feeling that the user is transported there. The trampoline has a safety net that is covered in black fabric 
			to separate the user from the surroundings and trying to set the user in the right mindset; that they are on Mars. 
			When the user enters the trampoline they have the big screen in front of them and the Kinect camera is placed under 
			the screen to read the user’s movements. When the user has been calibrated they will be represented as a green avatar, 
			and gold coins will start falling which the user will have to catch by jumping. When the user jumps it will feel like 
			a normal jump on the trampoline, but in the game the avatar will be affected by the gravity as if it is on Mars. 
			The user will have 90 seconds to catch as many gold coins as possible. -->
